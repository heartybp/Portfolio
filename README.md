# [Personal Portfolio Website](https://heartybp.github.io/Portfolio/)

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, a project I built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Although I have experience with frameworks like React and TailWind CSS, I opted to use vanilla technologies to exercise greater control over custom styles and positioning.

## Features

### 1. Flip Card Avatar Effect
I implemented a 3D flip card for my avatar that creates a dynamic effect when hovered over. For guidance, I referenced the tutorial on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp).

### 2. TypeWriter Effect
The website also features a typewriter animation that cycles through different texts. Initially, I referenced the basic typewriter tutorial from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp), but I extended the functionality to allow for an infinite loop of multiple texts, modifying it based on other resources.

### 3. Graphic Icons & Images
The icons and images on the website were sourced and customized via **Canva**, which also aided me in drafting the overall visual design.

### 4. Responsiveness & Accessibility
The site is designed to be responsive, adjusting to various screen sizes and device resolutions. It supports most browser resizing and aims to deliver a consistent experience across devices.

## Known Issues
While the site is functional, there are a few areas that need improvement:
- The **typewriter text** tends to misalign when resizing the browser.
- The site currently doesn't fully support responsiveness when **zooming** in/out in the browser.
- A **horizontal overflow** may appear when refreshing the browser, or when zooming in/out on mobile devices.
- On **Mozilla Firefox**, the flip card's back graphic isn't hidden during the flip transition.

## Future Improvements
I plan to learn the necessary skills to improve the website’s responsiveness and accessibility. By expanding my knowledge, I aim to do a better job of handling these challenges in future projects.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio site! Feel free to explore and reach out with any feedback.
